Always start stepbystep.
1. create board
    1. board will have cells.
    2. cells will have pieces.
2. pieces are of 2 colors. Each piece will have own moves and hence moves need to be validated.
3. pieces are of 8 types (PAWN,KING,etc)
4. initialise the board and players and start game.
5. player1 will start and try to move a piece from source cell to dest cell.
    1. validate if move(start,end) position are within board range.
    2. validate piece color and the player playing are correct.
    3. check if move is allowed by move-validator for respective piece.
    4. If it's valid, remove the piece from source and updated position of piece to dest.
    5. Check if player1 has won the game. if yes, break it. else ask player to repeat step 5.
